<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">This</span> is a modest, gossipy and allusive sketch of a
delightful part of England, designed rather to
arouse the interest and the curiosity of those not
already acquainted with what I will call the
“Middle West” than to fully satisfy it. If in
this connection you choose to regard the author
of these pages as a commercial traveller in the
interest of Wessex, displaying samples of the
picturesque wares the West of England can offer
the tourist, it will entirely fit the humour in
which they were penned. To aid the medium of
words is added a feast of colour in the accompanying
selected views, which show the lovely golden
russet interior of Sherborne Abbey, the misty
rich blue haze of Blackmore Vale, the architectural
majesty of Wells, and much else that
awaits the traveller in Dorset and Somerset.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Wessex of which I shall treat in these
gossiping pages is that Wessex of romance and
of the great dairy-farms, which has been little
touched by the influence of railways. Hampshire
and Wiltshire—Winchester and Salisbury—have
become too closely in touch with London to stand
so fully upon the ancient ways as does Dorset,
with the greater part of its north-western neighbour,
Somerset. But in these rural territories
the countryman still talks the old broad Do’set
and Zummerzet speech, in which the letter
“o” in every possible circumstance becomes
“a,” as you will perceive in that old rhyme
beginning:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A harnet zet in a holler tree,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And thus he zung as he did zet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“My sting is as zharp as a bagginet.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And they think, too, the olden thoughts.</p>

<p>Nothing can give one a greater sense of the
difference between the exploited modernized
coast-line and the real old Wessex than the journey
from up-to-date Bournemouth to Poole, that
olden nest of smugglers, and thence across to the
untamed heaths and to Wareham. In this way,
then, we will begin our exploration of Wessex.</p>

<p>Wareham is a little town which has been left
to drowse peacefully in its old days. Nothing
has happened in Wareham since its almost complete
destruction by fire (1762), an event which
here as distinctly marks an era as does the Great
Fire of London in the City. It not only rubricates
the local table of events with a glowing
finger, but the rebuilding necessary after it has
set a specious stamp of modernity upon the place,
to which its long and troubled history and its
two ancient churches give an emphatic denial.
Mr. Hardy styles Wareham “Anglebury,” and it
is a name which well befits a town whose story is
so greatly concerned with the settlement of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Anglo-Saxons in Dorset and the fortunes of the
older kingdom of Wessex. The original founders
of Wareham, who were probably antecedent to the
Anglo-Saxons, were very properly afraid of overseas
rovers, who might sail into Poole Harbour and
attack them, and they raised around the place
those huge ditches and embankments which
remain to this day to astonish the stranger, and
are known as the “walls of Wareham.” Covered
with grass, the summit of them forms an interesting
ramble. But these defences never did confer
upon Wareham the desired security. Its early
story is one of continual capture, and it had been
burnt so often that the inhabitants had at last
feared to rebuild it and live there again; and it
was a deserted place William the Conqueror found.
He caused a castle to be built, but that fortress in
its long career again and again invited siege and
plunder, until it was at last destroyed in the
troubles between Charles I. and his Parliament.
The last pitiful scene was in 1685, when three
rebels in the Monmouth rising were hanged on
the famous walls, at a corner still known as
“Bloody Bank.” The chief architectural interest
is centred upon the ancient church of St. Martin,
a curiously-proportioned building, standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
piquantly beside the road outside the town, to
the north, on a little bank or terrace. The
antiquary perceives by a mere glance at its stilted
narrow and lofty proportions that it is Saxon, and
the interior discloses a lofty nave of stern unornamental
appearance, with characteristic Saxon
chancel arch, the whole closely resembling the
interior of the Saxon church of Bradford-on-Avon.
The Church of St. Mary, at the other extremity
of the town, possesses a hexagonal leaden font,
one of the twenty-seven leaden fonts in England.</p>

  <div class="caption smaller">
<p>The massive ruins of the great castle of Corfe owe their present appearance to the blowing-up of the fortress by
gunpowder, in 1646, after its capture by the Parliament.</p></div></div>

<p>Six miles north-west of Wareham we come to
Bere Regis, a place very notable in the Hardy
literature, for it is the “Kingsbere” of <i>Tess of the
D’Urbervilles</i>, and the “Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill”
of <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>. Before ever it
acquired the kingly prefix or suffix, it was merely
“Bere,” a word which explained its situation
amid underwoods and copses. I have all the will
in the world to describe Bere Regis as “picturesque”;
but it is not that. It is an old rather
grim and grey village that has had troubles—not
romantic troubles, please to understand, but
economic ones. It has a “past”—neither scandalous
nor noble, but just the past of a place that
has seen better days and has suffered—suffered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
truly, in the peculiarly Dorset way, from fire.
How many times the dry thatch of the cottages
has gone up in flame and smoke I know not;
only I know—and all may see—that experience
has not made the villagers wise, for it is a long
street of thatched cottages yet; and here and
there is the ruin of one more recently burnt
in like manner. The scattered heaps remain
untouched, for it is not worth the while to rebuild
in Bere Regis. That is why the heavily-thatched
roofs, with little bedroom windows peering out
like weary-lidded eyes, look to me grim and sad.
The church is fine, and owes much of its beauty
to the ancient Turberville family, something to
the Abbey of Tarent, and most of all to Cardinal
Morton, a native of this parish. He is said to
have given the noble—indeed, the extraordinarily
noble—elaborately carved, painted and gilded
roof of the nave, which by itself would make the
artistic reputation of a church. It is really not a
West of England roof at all, but distinctly of the
East Anglian type, and there are legends that
explain the bringing of it here. However that
may be, it is a bold and striking object; the
hammer-beams carved into the huge shapes of
Bishops, Cardinals, and pilgrims, with immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
round faces carved on the bosses, which look
down upon you with fat, complacent smiles.
Add to this the fact that the figures are painted
with flesh-tints and the costumes vividly coloured,
and it will be guessed that this is a remarkable
work. Here are interesting carved fifteenth-century
bench-ends, and on two of the Transitional
Norman pillars extraordinary sculptures of
heads—one tugging open its mouth, the other
with hand to forehead. They are popularly
said to be “Toothache” and “Headache,” but
were probably intended to symbolize the divine
gifts of speech and sight. Battered old Purbeck
marble tombs of the bygone Turbervilles are seen
here.</p>

<p>Bere Regis is a fine point whence to explore
into what Mr. Thomas Hardy styles “Egdon
Heath.” By that name the wild stretch of
moorlands marked on the maps as “Bere Heath,”
“Hyde Heath,” “Decoy Heath,” etc., is understood,
chiefly between Wareham on the east
and Dorchester on the west, and roughly bounded
on the south by the River Frome. It is not
merely a wild, but also a very beautiful, region,
on whose borders the novelist himself, the creator
of so many alluring rustics, and the true begetter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
of the Hardy Country, was born, at Upper Bockhampton,
1840. Nature reigns, unchallenged,
on these swarthy moors of brown and purple.
He tells us, truly, how this country figures in
Domesday. “Its condition is recorded therein
as that of heathy, furzy, briary wilderness—‘Bruaria.’”
Leland, writing in the reign of
Henry VII., describes this tract as “overgrown
with heth and mosse”; and as it was in the
eleventh and in the sixteenth centuries, so it
remains in the twentieth. In these untamed
scenes the sombre novel of <i>The Return of the
Native</i> is set.</p>

<span class="subhead">CORFE CASTLE—SWANAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">From</span> Wareham we cross the Frome by an
ancient bridge, and enter the Isle of Purbeck.
The road runs a straight four miles to Corfe,
across a heath in which the activities of clay-cutters
will be observed. Soon Corfe Castle
appears ahead, the mighty upstanding ruins of
ancient keep and surrounding walls rising from
an abrupt hill curiously situated in a gap of a
great range of heights. The stony little town
of Corfe comes only after we have swung round
by the curving road under the castle hill, and
it is well it should be so; for thus, with but
the frowning steeps, crested by the military
architecture of the medieval times, for company,
we obtain the true romantic touch which the
little domestic details of the townlet itself
would destroy.</p>

<p>It is a romance of cruelty and blood, for which
the great castle of Corfe stands. It arose in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
great fortress-building era that followed the
establishment of the Conqueror’s rule, upon a
site already bloodstained and ominous with the
murder of King Edward “the Martyr,” <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 978,
by his stepmother, Queen Elfrida, and it was
no sooner built than besieged. King John
imprisoned in its dungeons twenty-four knights,
adherents of Prince Arthur, captured in Brittany,
and either caused them to be starved to death
or ended by foul and midnight assassination.
And so through the centuries it stood, with
constant additions, until there came at last a time
when even these stout walls of from ten to
fourteen feet thickness were shivered. That was
when the castle surrendered to treachery in 1646,
after a long siege by the Parliament’s forces. It
had withstood a fortnight’s siege in 1643, when
the gallant defender, Lady Bankes, beat off horse
and men, cannon and siege-train; but now the
ancient place was undermined, and gunpowder
laid in its foundations. Matches were applied,
and the fortress was blown into ruin. As it was
left in this process of “slighting,” as the Cromwellians
termed their new way with old castles,
so it remains to-day.</p>

<p>The gaunt ruins rear boldly up above the
stony little town—an impressive sight; and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
you go onwards toward Swanage, a backward
glance now and then shows how far they
dominate the landscape.</p>

<p>And so into Swanage. Time was when such
a thing as a brick was a strange thing here and
a brick house practically unknown, for the building-stone
for which Purbeck is famous was and
is the natural material, cheap and plentiful. But
things have indeed changed since the coming of
the railway into Swanage, and the old stony
fishing village is now in great measure a red-brick
town, and there are hotels on the seashore
that glow like geraniums. There are strange
expatriated things in and about Swanage—strange
in these surroundings, but ordinary enough in
London, whence they came. The great figures
in Swanage some forty years ago were Mr.
Mowlem and Mr. Burt, of the London contracting
firm of Mowlem and Burt, and thus many of
the miscellaneous discarded things that found
their way into the firm’s yard came at last to a
resting-place here. Thus the Town Hall frontage
was formerly that of Mercers’ Hall in Cheapside,
and the Gothic clock-tower that stands on the
shore was formerly on the south side of London
Bridge, where it was erected as a memorial to
the Duke of Wellington. The lamp-posts in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the streets once served the same office in the
streets of Westminster and other districts of
London, and still bear their old distinctive marks.
But the handiwork of the amazing Burt did not
end here. He conceived the idea of developing
Swanage in the direction of Durlston Head, a
stony promontory about one mile to the west,
and marked out many roads along what he was
pleased to call the “Durlston Park Estate.”
The whole thing remains at this day a derelict
affair, the text for a sermon on the Vanity of
Human Wishes. Nobody ever wanted to live
on those steep gradients of the Durlston Park
Estate. The roads end at the headland, where,
among other manifestations of the Burt whimsies,
adjoining the old Tilly Whim caves, on a platform
overlooking the sea, is a thing quite famous,
locally, as “The Great Globe.” This is an
enormous stone globe, some ten feet in height,
engraved with representations of the seas and
continents of the earth. Behind it, on large
tablets, is inscribed a mass of astronomical
information, in which most of the family secrets
of the solar system are laid bare; and, with a
care for the weaknesses of human nature, there
are slabs on which those visitors who feel they
must carve their names are invited to do so.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> seventeen miles between Wareham and
Dorchester, through Wool and Warmwell Cross,
traverse pretty country and encounter interesting
places. Passing the “Pure Drop” Inn, we come
to the hamlet of East Stoke. Half a mile to the
left, across the River Frome, which runs parallel
with the road thus far, are the scanty remains of
Bindon Abbey, in a dark situation amid dense
trees, and with black and stagnant moat. The
stone sarcophagus of some forgotten Abbot of
Bindon, resting on the grass, figures in <i>Tess of the
D’Urbervilles</i> as that in which the sleep-walking
Angel Clare laid Tess. We now come suddenly
upon a delightful scene, as the road to Wool is
resumed. There, on the right, on the other side
of the sedgy Frome, rise the steep roofs and
clustered chimneys of such a romantic-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Elizabethan manor-house as those that were used
years ago to make the fortunes of Christmas
numbers, in tales of ghosts and hauntings. This
is Woolbridge House. The bridge by which
one crosses the Frome to it is much more ancient
than the house itself, and is a fine, stone-built
Gothic structure, with pointed arches and cut-waters
up and down stream. The mansion, now
a farmhouse belonging to the Erle-Drax family,
was once the property of the Turbervilles, who
became possessed of some of the lands of Bindon
Abbey; and it is therefore with every warranty
that Mr. Hardy made the old place figure in his
greatest novel, <i>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</i>. Moreover,
it does not merely look as though it should
be haunted, but actually has, or had, that reputation.
It is a particularly creepy and full-flavoured
ghost-story that belongs to Woolbridge House—none
other, indeed, than that of a passionate
Turberville who murdered one of his guests when
out for a drive in the family chariot. Unfortunately,
this inhospitable deed was perpetrated
“once upon a time,” which is the nearest thing
the serious historian can make of it; and it will
be conceded that this presents some difficulties
for the inquirer. The guest, it appears, was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
of the family. For many generations the awful
apparition of the Turberville coach was believed
in, but we do not hear so much of it in these
times. It was accustomed to drive up at nights
to the house, in every detail of ghastly horror.
Ordinary persons—plebeian rustics and the like—might
hear it, but only those in whose veins
coursed the old hot Turberville blood might
actually see the apparition; and as there is not
anyone locally known to be of kin to that ancient
family, it follows of necessity that ghostly manifestations
have long since ceased. But in his
novel Mr. Hardy has made splendid use of the
old house and of the two life-size portraits of
women, supposed to be Turbervilles, that are
painted on upstairs walls.</p>

<p>The immediate neighbour of Woolbridge
House, on this side of the Frome, is Wool railway-station,
and on the left again is the village
of Wool. The coast is reached in four and a
half miles, at Lulworth, where those who do not
feel equal to thoroughly tracing the wild and
solitary and extremely beautiful coast-line of
Dorset can at least sample it at one of its most
delightful spots. There are two closely-neighboured
Lulworths—East Lulworth, inland, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the curious castle, built about 1599–1650 by
Lord Bindon and his successors, the Weld family,
is seen; and West Lulworth, through which one
descends to the Cove. This is an almost perfect
circle, eaten out of the limestone rock by the sea,
and surrounded on the landward side by bold treeless
downs. Summer at Lulworth is a sheer
delight for those who like quiet holidays. The
Cove, with its light blue waters, looks a veritable
bath of the Naiads, and should be, if such things
were, the watery boudoir of mermaids. Here
the cliffs rise up to sheer dizzy heights on the
western horn of the tiny bay, with wildly contorted
strata and truly awful chasms at Stair
Hole. The like upside-down condition of the
local geology may be observed at the romantic
spot, some two miles farther west, called Durdle
Door, where the cliffs plunge into the sea with
their stratification perpendicular and streaked with
the loveliest tints. The “door” of Durdle Door
is a natural archway in the cliffs. If time and
energy permit, there is a splendid field for exploration
eastwards, past East Lulworth and on to
Arishmill Gap, Worbarrow Bay, and Kimmeridge.</p>

<p>But to resume the inland road to Dorchester.
From Wool we come in some four miles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Owermoigne, a rustic village of thatched cottages
which figures as “Nether Mynton” in that
diverting short story <i>The Distracted Preacher</i>, a
tale of smugglers and their quaint ways with lace
and brandy-tubs and the old church, founded on
the actual doings of the “free-traders” who were
accustomed to hide their contraband in the
church tower, in the pulpit itself, or in the tombs
of the rude forefathers of the village. At the
cross-roads beyond Owermoigne, known as
“Warmwell Cross,” a ready way lies into
Weymouth, through Poxwell, Osmington, and
Preston, a route with its own especial features—such,
for instance, as the charming old manor-house
of Poxwell, the “Oxwell” of <i>The Trumpet
Major</i>, with the tall walls enclosing its grounds
and the pretty architectural detail of a porter’s
lodge. The mansion is now a farmhouse. From
Osmington steep ways lead down to a favourite
excursion from Weymouth, the romantic Osmington
Mills, near the sea. Here one may observe
on the steep grassy sides of the hills the martial
equestrian effigy of George III., whose making is
described so humorously in <i>The Trumpet Major</i>:
“The King’s head is to be as big as our millpond,
and his body as big as this garden; he and
the horse will cover more than an acre.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Descending steeply through Preston, Weymouth
is reached along some two miles of level,
skirting the curving shores of Weymouth Bay.</p>

<p>Weymouth, created for all practical purposes
by George III., just as Brighton arose under the
patronage of his son, George IV., is a likeable
place, and not at all out of touch with the real
Wessex. For it is of the Weymouth of <i>The
Trumpet Major</i>, that delightful end-of-the-eighteenth-century
love-story, that one thinks
as the town is entered. It is as “Budmouth”
that it finds mention in those pages, and the
“Budmouth” of the Georgian period it in all
essentials remains, with the staid red-brick houses
of that time still lining the curving shore, which
enthusiasts liken to the curving shores of the
Bay of Naples. And, indeed, the sea in Weymouth
Bay is often of a wondrous opalescent
blue, rare enough off our coasts. The inhabitants
of Weymouth did well to raise a statue to
“Farmer George,” as an acknowledgment of
benefits received. It was unveiled in 1810, and
has since that time aroused the mingled amusement
and contempt of all sorts and conditions of
men. For my part, I keep all my contempt for
the public statues erected in London yester-year,
and cherish a liking for that statue and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
surroundings. It is at least a composition, and
one ought to feel grateful to the sculptor, who
represented the King in the ordinary dress of the
age, instead of in an impossible Roman costume.</p>

<p>Behind this statue is St. Mary’s Street, narrow,
with a congeries of narrower alleys leading out
of it. This is the most picturesque corner of the
town, and gives upon the harbour, past a house in
whose gable wall still rests the cannon-shot fired
in the siege of 1644. The harbour is really the
sea-estuary of the River Wey. The old original
Weymouth is on the other side, with the beautiful
backwater on the right, reaching to Radipole.</p>

<p>The chief scenic asset of Weymouth is, of
course, the great rock of Portland, the Gibraltar
of Wessex, the “Isle of Portland,” tethered to
the mainland only by the long shingly spit of
the Chesil Beach. Thence comes the famous
Portland stone, and there is the equally famous
Portland Prison. There, too, are forts with
heavy guns, the great breakwater, and various
other appointments and developments that render
this a strong naval rendezvous. A great assemblage
of battleships in Weymouth Bay is not
the least among the many attractions that Weymouth
has to offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
On the crest of the steep hill at Wyke, as you
leave the town for Portland, is the great church
of Wyke Regis, the mother-church of Weymouth,
with memorials of many sailors wrecked in
Deadman’s Bay, which extends westward from
Portland to Bridport. Here, too, the diligent
may seek and find the epitaph of one “William
Lewis, who was killed by a shot from the <i>Pigmy</i>
schooner, 21st April, 1822. Aged 33 years.”
Lewis was a smuggler, killed in the course of
one of his illegal expeditions; but the verses
upon his tombstone take no count of that, and
call down curses upon whoever fired the shot.</p>

<p>From Wyke the road descends steeply, and,
crossing the Fleet Bridge, leads along two miles
of flat road across the Chesil Beach. The stranger
would hardly expect to see so much shingle
in the whole world as he finds here. It is a
vast accumulation of pebbles running westward
hence as far as West Bay, Bridport. Its total
length is eighteen miles, and it varies from a
hundred yards to more than a quarter of a mile
in breadth, its pebbles ranging gradually in size
from Brobdingnagian specimens, about the size
of a breakfast-plate, at Portland to the tiniest
particles at West Bay.</p>

<p class="in0">Pleasant by-roads lead across tributaries of the
Frome and into Stinsford, which is in the heart
of the Hardy Country, about two miles from
Dorchester. It is a secluded place amid massed
woods and at the edge of the fine park surrounding
Kingston House. Stinsford is the “Mellstock”
of that sweet idyll <i>Under the Greenwood
Tree</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Beyond it we gain the highroad that leads
down on the left into Dorchester. The right-hand
route conducts up Yellowham Hill to
Piddletown; or the stranger may on some
summer day be well content to lose himself in
the sylvan wilds in the valley of the Frome,
through the hamlet of Upper Bockhampton,
where the rustic cottage that was the birthplace
of Thomas Hardy may be seen on the very verge
of the open, under Ilsington Woods. There,
where the blue wood-smoke from rustic chimneys
ascends amid dense foliage, and where the swart
heaths begin, he learned his “wood-notes wild.”
Piddletown Church, with its monuments of the
Martins of Athelhampton, and the fine Jacobean
minstrel gallery, is well worth seeing, for its own
sake and for its associations in the Wessex novels,
in which it figures prominently as “Weatherbury.”
At Lower Walterstone, about one mile north, is
the beautiful Jacobean farmhouse described in
<i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> as the home of
Bathsheba Everdene.</p>

<p>Coming into Dorchester, the road traverses
the water-meadows of the Frome, over the spot
called Ten Hatches, and across the little bridges
that were the scene of Henchard’s despair, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
<i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i>. “Casterbridge,” as
everyone familiar with Wessex knows, is Dorchester—and
an excellent name, too, for this
grave town of early British and Roman antecedents.
It would be vain to pretend that
Dorchester is picturesque. If you expect in it
nodding gables, and half-timbered fifteenth-century
buildings to be the note of it, you will
experience a disappointment in seeing the real
thing. For the general aspect of the town is
one of Georgian four-square respectability, and
sky-lines are apt to be horizontal instead of at
acute angles. There are, however, older things
by far at Dorchester. At Fordington, for instance,
which is an integral part of the town,
there have been discovered Roman remains, as,
indeed, they have been plentifully unearthed all
in and about the borough. The tympanum over
the south door of the parish church is exceptionally
well worth inspection. It is a very remarkable
example of Norman sculpture, and represents
the miraculous appearance of St. George on horseback
at the Battle of Dorylæum. The figures
are full of life and vigour, except those represented
as being dead, and they look very dead indeed.
St. George is shown in the act of thrusting his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
lance into the mouth of one of the enemy, who
vainly endeavours to pluck it out. At the back
are two others of the foe, stricken with fear at
this horrible sight, and praying on their knees
for mercy. The peculiar interest of this sculpture
lies in the fact that all the actors in this scene are
represented in Norman chain-mail.</p>

<div id="ip_27" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="600" height="398" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Near Maiden Castle.</span></p></div>
  <div class="caption smaller">

<p>The prehistoric earthworks frown darkly against the skyline to the west of Dorchester.</p></div></div>

<p>There is an unmistakably “county-town”
atmosphere in Dorchester, which is a distinctly
urban place, and not now of that thinly-modified
rusticity described long ago by Thomas Hardy:
“The farmer’s boy could sit under his barleymow
and pitch a stone into the window of the town
clerk; reapers at work among the sheaves nodded
to acquaintances standing on the pavement-corner;
the red-robed judge, when he condemned a sheep-stealer,
pronounced sentence to the tune of ‘Baa’
that floated in at the window from the remainder
of the flock browsing hard by.”</p>

<p>No, modern Dorchester is not like that, and
its chief features—the noble elm avenues, that
struck the traveller by road into and out of the
town with admiration—have had their exquisite
nobility qualified by time and change. Those
grand avenues extended north, south, east, and
west; but to-day they have in some cases disappeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and in others have been obscured by
suburban buildings, that have shut out the views
of the fields from the pavements. Dorchester,
however, is rich in notable things. As you enter
it from Piddletown and Ten Hatches, and rise up
along High East Street to Cornhill, which is the
very centre of the town, you approach the grey
old church of St. Peter, and note in the flagged
space beneath the tower the bronze statue of
William Barnes, the “Dorset poet,” 1801–1886,
with a verse aptly chosen from his own writings:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Zoo now I hope his kindly fëace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is gone to vind a better plëace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still wi’ vo’k a’ left behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’ll always be a’ kept in mind.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thus appropriately, in the olden Wessex folk-speech
he did so much to preserve, is the memory
of the amiable “Pa’son Barnes” kept alive.</p>

<p>Much else is changed, but still on market-days
the country-folk come pouring into what they to
this day call “Darchester.” They come into it
chiefly by carrier’s cart, or by dogcarts and other
road vehicles, just as of yore; and although the
market-day assemblage of carriers’ tilt-carts is
an astonishing survival in numerous old English
towns, there are nowhere to be seen so astonishingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
many as here; and the occupants of them
are not infrequently such genuine old crusted
characters as you read of, and wag the same old
Wessex tongue. For the rest, Dorchester has
the Roman encampment of Poundbury and the
amphitheatre of Maumbury to show; in High
West Street is the house, duly marked, where
the infamous Judge Jeffreys lodged when on his
Assize of Blood in 1685, and in the Town Hall
his chair is shown. While some things have
changed, other trivial details have remained the
same for considerably over a century. Thus,
Rowlandson in 1797 made a drawing of King
George III. being driven in a post-chaise to the
“King’s Arms.” The “King’s Arms” Hotel
still stands where it did, and looks in every
respect the selfsame place, which is itself a remarkable
proof of the abiding nature of our
institutions; but what is yet more remarkable
is the fact that the selfsame, indubitable individual
old flower-pots are on the roof of the
portico yet. In the face of the destiny of all
flower-pots to be resolved at some time into
potsherds, and in view of the many times when
the roof of that portico must have been used, on
election and other occasions, as a convenient place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
whence to harangue excited crowds, their survival
is strange indeed.</p>

<p>For the rest, a gruesome little cottage will be
found by taking the road out of High West
Street known as Glydepath Lane, and following
it to a fine damp situation near the river. It is
only gruesome when you know its old story;
otherwise it is a quite idyllic little thatched
cottage, and stands in a nice garden. But it is
handy to Dorchester Gaol, and it was the
hangman’s cottage. In this same street is a
mingled grim and stately great early eighteenth-century
mansion, known as Colyton House. The
hideously battered keystone mask in the blocked-up
archway of one of its outbuildings has been
appropriated, and made literary capital of, by
Mr. Hardy in <i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i>. “High
Place Hall,” the home of Lucetta, Henchard’s
lady-love in that story, is really a house at the
corner of South Street and Durngate Street, but
he transfers the unlovely thing from Colyton
House to it. He has an extraordinary aptitude
for seeing something malignant and inimical in
lifeless objects, and you are almost persuaded that
there was some malevolence in this that wrought
Henchard’s ruin.</p>

Comparatively few are those who explore from
Dorchester along the old Exeter road to Bridport,
for the scenery is wild and the road lonely and
steep. Well, then, what of that? Those places
are few indeed where level roads accompany
rugged scenery. Explore those fourteen miles.
Truly they will reward the amateur of scenery:
the lofty ridge whose summit is reached three
parts of the way revealing widespreading views
out to sea on the left, and over wonderful hills
and vales inland on the right. You have a taste
of what this route is like immediately after
leaving Dorchester and its western avenue behind,
for cresting the sky-line of the downs on the left
are the giant prehistoric earthworks of Maiden
Castle, glooming darkly upon the road. Who
delved the deep and lofty ditches and embankments,
the amazing concentric and overlapping
circles enclosing the vast camp on yonder height?
Nay, who among the ancient peoples that warred
in Britain from the earliest prehistoric times until
the dawn of history did <em>not</em> have a hand in that
immense fortification and camp of refuge? It
was old when the Romans came and added their
quota of spade-work to it. But this at least we
may deduce from those cyclopean earthworks:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
that those who made them and added to them
must have been horribly afraid, thus to seek the
defensive so diligently, instead of going out to
battle in the open. Unquestionably, ancient warfares
must have raged along this way, for prehistoric
tumuli are plentiful along the downs as
we progress.</p>

<p>Passing Bridehead Park, a road leads steeply
down on the left to Longbredy, where will be
found the deserted old manor-house of Kingston
Russell, whence the Russells, Dukes of Bedford,
sprang from obscurity in 1502, in the person of
the courtly and ingratiating John Russell.
Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy was also
born here, and under the same roof died John
Lothrop Motley, historian of the Dutch Republic,
some thirty years ago. Approaching Bridport, a
stone at the corner of the hedgerow in Lee Lane
on the right commemorates what Fuller styles
the “Miraculous Divergence,” the escape of
Charles II., September 23, 1651, when he baffled
his pursuers by turning out of the main road at
this point.</p>

<p>Bridport town stands upon its sponsorial little
river, Brit, about one and a half miles from the
sea, at West Bay. There, on the exposed seashore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
of what is often styled “Deadman’s Bay,” the
river slides into the Channel. West Bay is the
queerest of places. It has a small harbour, formed
by locking up the river behind lock-gates, and
two parallel wooden jetties start hazardously out
from the beach. In and out of this harbour
small sailing-vessels make their way; and certain
scattered cottages, the Bridport Arms Inn, and
some few recent houses, all standing in the sands
and minute gravel of the Chesil Beach, which
ends here, make believe that West Bay is a seaside
resort. On either side of it the cliffs rise to
great heights, and are partly of a friable, earthy
nature, yellow in hue.</p>

<span class="subhead">CERNE ABBAS—THE VALE OF BLACKMORE—SHERBORNE—SHAFTESBURY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Northwards</span> out of Dorchester we come by
favour of the long straight old Bristol road into
the heart of the great Wessex dairying district of
Blackmore Vale; but before reaching that region
of green fatness we pass through the country
associated in the minds of all readers of the Wessex
novels with <i>The Woodlanders</i>. The road goes
through the village of Charminster and in the
valley of the little river Cerne, under the chalk
downs that gradually rise as the decayed town
of Cerne Abbas is approached. Just where the
shoulders of those lofty chalk hills are at their
highest and steepest, the stranger will see with
that gasp of astonishment which is the proper
meed of such a thing the gigantic figure of a man
outlined upon the grass. This is the “Giant of
Cerne,” who well deserves that name, for he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
180 feet high. He is represented wielding an
immense club, which he flourishes over his head.
The history of this singular figure is, like that of
the several “White Horses” cut on hillsides in
various parts of England, and like the famous
“Long Man of Wilmington,” on the downs near
Eastbourne, unknown. Whether the monks of
the Benedictine Abbey of Cerne traced his outlines,
or whether, as legends declare, this was a
work of the early pagan Saxons, and intended by
them to represent their god, Heil, to whom
human sacrifices were offered here, must ever be
matters for conjecture.</p>

<p>If you would make acquaintance with a dead
town, allow me to introduce you to Cerne Abbas.
It is a weary, age-worn place, a little off the main
road, and rapidly falling into decay. It suffered
when the great abbey, of which the noble
Perpendicular gatehouse remains, was dissolved;
but it experienced a considerable revival in the
great days for agriculture, when the Napoleonic
wars sent up the price of corn and made the
farmers happy. You may see the signs of this in
the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century
houses in the place, with large shop-fronts. Those
shop-fronts tell a tale, for they are for the greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
part no longer shops, and serve as the immeasurably
too large windows for sitting-rooms. The
great final causes of the decline and fall of Cerne
Abbas were the coming of railways, which
rendered so many small towns and rural markets
no longer necessary, and the failure of agriculture.
So Cerne is dead. You will find no deader townlet
in England. Therefore let us pace reverently
her empty streets.</p>

<p>We now come between the hills to the pretty
village of Minterne Magna, which is the “Great
Hintock” of <i>The Woodlanders</i>. “Here,” says a
rustic wag in that story, “you do see the world
and life.” Not much, though, for although the
old Bristol road is still an excellent highway, it is
not precisely crowded. Beyond the extremely
small village the road reaches the steep escarpment
whence the great bastioned mid-Dorset
heights go, in many places with dramatic steepness
down into the far-spreading Blackmore Vale.
The road itself naturally descends at the least steep
place to the levels of Middlemarsh; but it is very
well worth while to explore for some distance
along the by-road to the left, which follows the
very edge of this ridge. Here is the lofty height
of High Stoy, with its great neighbours, Dogbury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Bulbarrow, and Nettlecombe Tout. Three miles
along this byway brings you past the most striking
scenery to the lofty down above Batcombe, passing
on the way the lonely, mysterious stone
pillar called “Cross-in-Hand,” associated with a
dramatic episode in <i>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</i>. It
is described rather curiously in those pages as
“the scene of a miracle or murder, or both.”</p>

<p>Beyond where Batcombe Church is seen, down
in the profound vale, the road goes into a secluded
region, where the three Melbury villages and that
of Evershot cluster about the noble Melbury
Park, seat of the Earl of Ilchester. The great
mansion is the “King’s Hintock Court,” of that
delightful story, “The First Countess of Wessex,”
in <i>A Group of Noble Dames</i>. The tiny village of
Melbury Osmund, the Hardyean “Little Hintock,”
is described, aptly enough, by one of his
characters as “such a small place that you’d need
a candle and lantern to find it, if you don’t know
where ’tis.”</p>

<p>Returning now from these Arcadian recesses,
we descend by the old Bristol road into the vale
at Middlemarsh, a part of that Vale of Blackmore
which has been described with such complete
justness as “This fertile and sheltered tract of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
country, in which the fields are never brown and
the springs never dry.... The atmosphere is
languorous, and is so tinged with azure that what
artists call the middle distance partakes also of
that hue, while the horizon beyond is of the
deepest ultramarine.” Dense scrub-woods are at
first met as we gain the Marshwood level, and
then die away as Holnest is reached—Holnest,
with its little church quite dwarfed by the huge
mausoleum erected by the late J. S. W. S. Erle-Drax
for himself. Near at hand is Holnest
Lodge, one of that eccentric squire’s residences,
still with the tall column in front, crested by a
bronze statue of himself, erected by himself to
his own honour and glory, since no one else was
in the least likely to do so much for him.</p>

<p>In less than five miles we come into Sherborne,
that pleasant old town which still bears some
considerable traces of that cathedral-city dignity
of which it was deprived so long ago as 1078. It
is situated in a little vale of its own, the Vale of
that <i>Scir burne</i>, or clear, sparkling brook, which
made the spot seem so desirable to the monks
who were settled here by King Ina as early as
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 705. That stream originated the place-name,
while losing its own, for it is identical with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the River Yeo, or Ivel, which in turn gives a
name to Yeovil town, anciently called “Ivell.”</p>

<p>The great glory of Sherborne is, of course, its
noble abbey church, standing in its own precincts,
reached through a low-browed archway
out of the main street, past the beautiful old
“Monks’ Conduit.” This minster-like church—really
a minster in the technical sense of the
word, it having been the church of a Benedictine
monastery—is grouped with the buildings of the
Grammar School, itself founded by Edward VI.
from the spoils of that dissolved religious house,
and having its home in the old domestic buildings
of those Black Monks. It is a stately grouping.
The great church itself is of the loveliest form and
colour. Externally presenting the appearance of
a Late Perpendicular building, with architectural
details exhibiting the approach of the Renaissance,
the interior discloses, particularly in the transepts,
the fact that the core of the building is actually
in great degree Norman, and that the late fourteenth
and early fifteenth-century work is practically
a refacing in a later fashion. But the choir
is a rebuilding, effected after the fire of 1437—a
fire which still shows its traces in the reddened
patches on the golden-yellow Ham Hill sandstone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
whose lovely tints contribute so greatly
to the beauty of the soaring architecture of
clerestory and delicate fan vaulting. Sherborne,
history will not forget, gave a lead in modern
times to the passion for historical pageants, inaugurated
here in the great Sherborne Pageant
held in the grounds of Sherborne Castle Park,
1905. There, amid the ruins of the ancient
Bishop’s Castle, the story of the town for over
a thousand years was retold.</p>

<p>Some five miles west is Yeovil, that great
dairying centre; that neat and prosperous town,
looking so bright and cheerful with its houses of
the yellow Ham Hill stone, a sandstone that
reveals itself in the wayside cuttings as you
descend towards it down Babylon Hill. But
Yeovil has little of antiquity to show the visitor,
except those two old inns, the George and the
Castle, which face one another in High Street,
for it has rebuilt itself pretty thoroughly.</p>

<p>Sixteen miles eastward of Sherborne stands the
hill-top town of Shaftesbury, to which railways
do not come, and from whose eyrie all modern
developments turn aside. The milestones tell a
strange tale of so many miles to “Shaston,” and
it is not always that the traveller understands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Shaftesbury to be indicated under that disguise,
but as such it still remains in rustic speech. The
novelist tells us, in one voice with the ascertained
history of the place, how Shaftesbury was originally
the British “Caer Palladour.” It possessed three
mints, twelve satellite churches, attendant upon a
magnificent abbey, and many other architectural
glories, for which the stucco-fronted eighteenth
and early nineteenth century houses which now
constitute the main part of the town are a sorry
exchange. All those magnificences have disappeared,
like the baseless fabric of a vision; and
antiquaries to-day, grubbing in trenches and turning
over potato-patches, can do little more than
retrieve a few shattered stones and broken tiles
that hint of the vanished abbey’s former existence.
Three parish churches remain, and form a very
generous provision for the small place that Shaftesbury
long since became. But if, architecturally
speaking, the town is so negligible, the distant
views, both of it and from it, are grand. Blackmore
Vale is disclosed perhaps to its greatest
advantage from these heights, in that southward
view between St. Peter’s Church and the massive
time-stained buttresses on the right hand, which
mark the precincts of the long-abolished abbey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
The road descends from this point, incredibly steep,
and quite impossible for anything on wheels, seeing
that it goes down in a series of gigantic sett-paved
stairs. Framed in thus romantically, the view
across the most beautiful part of the Vale of
Blackmore extends far away until it melts in a
blue vagueness.</p>

<p>The streets of Shaftesbury have names a good
deal more picturesque than the houses that front
upon them. That of “Bimport” is an example.
In that quiet thoroughfare is the house styled
in <i>Jude the Obscure</i> “Old Grove’s Place.” It
is easily recognizable by reason of its projecting
porch.</p>

<span class="subhead">YATTON—CHEDDAR CHEESE AND CHEDDAR
CLIFFS—WELLS—GLASTONBURY—THE
ISLE OF ATHELNEY—DUNSTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> little town of Yatton, below Bristol, situated
on excellent roads and with a convenient station
on the Great Western main line, is a very useful
point whence to start upon a rambling exploration
of Mid and North Somerset, called by
Mr. Hardy “Outer Wessex.” Yatton is a
junction station, its name-board familiar to
travellers, with the alluring legend beneath:
“For Cheddar and Wells.” Whether the place-name
be really “Ea-ton” or “Yeo-ton,” from the
little river Yeo, on which the town is situated,
or “Gate-town,” from the road or “gate” under
the hills on which it stands, will ever remain a
problem to give antiquaries something to think
about. The church, one of the finest in this
shire of fine churches, has a remarkable outline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
because of its incomplete spire, whose upper part
appears never to have been added. It thus wears
a truncated appearance, and is crested with a kind
of coronet. The effect is distinctly pleasing and
gives Yatton a decided individuality. The general
appearance of the church is that of a Late
Decorated building. The tomb, with red-robed
effigy of Chief Justice Newton, of the Common
Pleas, 1449, is well worth seeing.</p>

<p>Through Congresbury and Churchill, whence
the Churchill family emerged from obscurity to a
dukedom and political fame in later generations,
we come, through the little town of Axbridge, to
Cheddar. There is no need, it may be presumed,
to instruct the reader in the two things for which
Cheddar is deservedly famous—its cheese and
cliffs. Time was, and that until quite recent years,
when the tourist who by some strange chance
knew nothing of Cheddar cheese might proceed
through the picturesque village without a glimpse
of its staple product. So modest was Cheddar
that no one would deduce or suspect a cheese in
the entire district. But nowadays—these being
days of strenuous publicity—shops that do nothing
else but sell cheeses are a feature of the place.
The results are extremely satisfactory, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
in view of the fact that inferior cheese from the
United States, known as “American Cheddar,”
was bulking largely in provision markets, and
bidding fair to wholly overshadow the home produce.
In these scientific times it is said to be
quite possible to produce Cheddar by the cultivation
of a bacillus, and that it is therefore the
method alone that makes the cheese, which can
be produced anywhere. But it would be a bad
day for the Somerset dairy-farmer if that doctrine
were accepted in its entirety, and it is comforting
to believe that it is not likely to win to such
acceptance.</p>

<p>Cheddar Cliffs are strikingly formed by huge
precipitous rifts in the limestone escarpments of
the Mendip Hills, and lead at right angles out of
the main road. The most picturesque portion of
the village is situated at the beginning of them,
beside the fine winding road that ascends between
their grey spires and impending fissures, looming
in monstrous shapes, like the fabled turrets and
bastions of some giant’s castle. The old geological
theory as to how these huge rifted chasms
were produced was of an earthquake that had
thus torn the everlasting hills asunder. But a
recent school of thought has the view that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
were originally immense caverns, and that the
gorge effect is caused by the roof having at some
time fallen in. The famous caverns, discovered
in 1837 and 1893, are cited as examples. These
are the chief attractions at Cheddar for the sightseer,
and are not in the least difficult to find,
because, in fact, they open upon the road and are
rented by rival proprietors who eagerly solicit the
stranger’s patronage. Whether the cave that
belongs to Cox or that which is exploited by
Gough is the better, I will not pretend to say;
only the mental impression left by perusing the
handbills and advertisements of the competitors
is that each is better than the other, “which,”
as our old enemy Euclid would say, “is
absurd.”</p>

<p>In another seven miles we come to the slumberous
cathedral city of Wells, in its rich vale
beneath the Mendips. The population of Wells
is about five thousand, and decreasing, or at the
most stationary, and thus there are no unhistorical
modern suburbs, and the outskirts are quite
innocent of notices offering land “ripe for building.”
It is true that there are two railway-stations
at Wells, but they are the product of
rival railway politics, rather than called into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
existence by necessity. I suppose the stranger
would deduce a river from the place-name, but
Wells knows nothing of the kind. It takes that
title from the clear springs that gush forth in the
neighbourhood of the cathedral, and form delightful
pools at its south-eastern end, serving also to
surround the fortified Bishop’s Palace with a
pellucid moat. The Diocese of Wells was founded
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 704 by Ina, King of Wessex. Never have
the rude buffetings of warfare disturbed the quiet
of the place, whose history is solely ecclesiastical,
and is concerned only with the long succession
of Bishops and the various rebuildings of the
cathedral. As we see it now, within its grassy
close, the cathedral is a singularly perfect work,
chiefly of the thirteenth century, rich above all
other English cathedrals in delicate sculpture, and
with sixty carved miserere seats that display the
sweetest artistic fancy, the closest study of natural
forms, and the most exquisite craftsmanship in
wood-carving to be found in England. Here,
too, is a curious fourteenth-century clock, still in
good going order. The Bishop’s Palace, largely
an Early English work, is a building beautiful
enough, and looking like enough to be the scene
of the legend of the Briar Rose and the Sleeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Beauty. Wells is the most cloistral of English
cathedral cities. It is the one ideal cathedral city
for scholar and poet that England possesses, for
the rest are for the most part pushful commercial
places, with electric tramways and the like manifestations
of modernity. Of these things Wells
knows nothing. The most startling thing I ever
saw at Wells was the Bishop riding a bicycle, and
he ran into me, which perhaps serves to show
that, although the mitred know the straight
celestial way, their terrestrial route on wheels is
sometimes not so forthright as that of the mere
layman. Lovely Wells, sweet with the last faint
afterglow of the Middle Ages, with ancient
houses, and some few comparatively modern,
facing the quiet market-place, closed in at its
eastern end by the great gate-houses of the
cathedral precincts, the towers of that stately
church peering up beyond.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">The Market Place, Wells.</span></p></div>
  <div class="captionl">

<p>Wells is the nearest approach in England to the ideal Cathedral city of poets and students, and the Market-place is so little
disturbed by markets that the plashing of the perennial springs which gives Wells its name is easily heard from the
fountain.</p></div></div>

<p>From Wells we come in little more than five
miles into Glastonbury, standing in the fabled
Arthurian “Vale of Avalon” of the poets. I
must confess that, many years ago, coming for the
first time into Glastonbury, I was disappointed.
I had read so deeply of Avalon—the Tennysonian
Avalon of apple orchards and mystic Round Table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
story—that I expected too much. Glastonbury
is indeed a commercial little town. Its population
is less than that of Wells, but it gives the impression
of being larger—perhaps because its people
are out and about doing things, while the folk at
Wells are engaged indoors in such meditations as
befit their ecclesiastical surroundings. Really, you
know, the roads into Glastonbury are quite good;
and there is gas in the streets and shops, and
everything that savours of the twentieth century—things
that somehow sink so far into the background
of it when reading Arthurian romance,
that you are unreasonably inclined to resent them
when coming into the town. Yet Glastonbury
is rich in relics of medievalism. You may even
come to your truly ancient inn here, just as did
the pilgrims of old before the abbey was dissolved
and the last Abbot and two of his monks were
hanged, a good deal higher than Haman, on the
lofty crest of Glastonbury Tor in 1539. Abbot
Selwood built what is now the George Hotel
in 1485 as a pilgrims’ hostel, and the ancient
frontage is still in existence. The abbey ruins,
which include the fine Transitional Norman
remains of St. Joseph’s Chapel, are situated in
lovely woodland grounds, and close by is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
even more interesting Abbot’s Kitchen, massive
and ecclesiastical-looking, dating from about 1420.</p>

<p>We may with advantage strike across country
from Glastonbury to Taunton, across the interesting
marshes of Sedgemoor—twenty-two miles.
Glastonbury, indeed, took its original title from
the Latin <i>Insula Vitrea</i>, a name formed by the
Romans from the British “Ynys Vitrin,” and
Englished by the Saxons into “Glaestingabyrig.”
This was a descriptive name, applied to the still,
glassy waters of the shallow inland sea which
then covered the whole of Sedgemoor with the
exception of a few islands. The town was one
of many lake-dwellings in these waters, overlooked
by the tall and steep Tor, rising strangely
to a height of 500 feet. Now crowned with the
fifteenth-century tower of a chapel of St. Michael,
this mountainous hill is a weird object in the
landscape for many miles.</p>

<p>We pass the boot-making village of Street, and
then the village of Greinton. Westonzoyland, with
its very large and very fine Perpendicular church,
two and a half miles on the right, is really an
Avalon, or apple island, and delightful in spring.
To the north of the village was fought the Battle
of Sedgemoor, July 6, 1685, and the church was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
afterwards used as a prison for some hundreds of
captured rebels.</p>

<p>The flat scenery of the moor, with dykes beside
the road filled with reeds and water, is varied by
strangely sudden hills here and there. One of
these is at Boroughbridge, a hamlet where we
cross the River Parret and enter the historic Isle
of Athelney. The hill, locally called “The
Mump,” is crested by the ruins of a chapel of
St. Michael. Here we enter a district associated
with the endearing story of Alfred the Great.
“He was England’s darling,” says the old Saxon
Chronicle, and so he remains. It was in this selfsame
Isle of Athelney that he lay hid amid the
marshes, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, 879, after the Saxon disasters in
battle with the Danes. An obelisk on a hillock
records the facts.</p>

<p>I should like to linger in the pleasant old town
of Taunton—“Taunton on the Tone,” as school
primers told us to style it—but I am bound for
Dunster, on the Severn Sea, and that is another
twenty-two miles distant. The road to it, past
Combe Florey, Crowcombe, Williton, and Washford,
is Somerset at its best, in every circumstance
of rustic beauty. At Washford is the ruined
Cleeve Abbey, the most interesting remains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
a Cistercian monastery in the West of England.
The church has wholly disappeared. The interest
lies in the domestic buildings and the cloisters,
together with the chapter-house and refectory, all
in the Early English style and very beautiful.</p>

<p>I choose Dunster to close this route because it
is one of those rare old towns which keep their
ancient manorial aspect, and neither increase nor
greatly decline. It owes this distinction to the
facts of being situated just off the road to anywhere
at all, and to being a mile or two away
from the sea, which in remote times came up to
the outworks of its castle, and made the place
a seaport. Dunster is a picture—nay, it is a
gallery of pictures, for one meets you at every
turn. There is the sleepy town of one broad
street, with the castle on its wooded height in
the background, and in the foreground the old
Yarn Market, a remarkable timber-framed building
which seems to be again awaiting the marketing
of yarn. It was built, they say, in 1609, and the
weather-vane, dated 1647, marks the repairs
effected after the siege of the castle in 1646.
That the reigning family of Dunster is named
Luttrell is evident from the name of the inn, the
Luttrell Arms, close by. This was in olden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
times a house of the Abbots of Cleeve, and still
retains some semi-ecclesiastical features, including
a fifteenth-century window of great size, with
many elaborate oaken mullions, looking upon the
courtyard. The fine priory church of Dunster,
with its sweet carillons, that play a different air
for every day of the week, the so-called “Nun’s
House,” the old water-mill—these are all delights
of Dunster. The castle, which is described as
“Stancy Castle” in Thomas Hardy’s novel <i>A
Laodicean</i>, is still the residence of the Luttrells.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">There</span> are ways from Wells to Bath somewhat
shorter than the twenty-four miles by which we
shall now proceed, but they take you up weariful
heights, over the long, swooping contours of the

way between Wells and Bath.</p>

<p>We leave the city through the cathedral close,
along its north side, and through the beautiful
Chain Gate, a work of the Perpendicular period,
connecting the cathedral with the Vicars’ College.
Presently begins the long rise of Horrington
Hill; and so up and again up goes the road, and
past the lonely Old Down Inn, coming at length
by Kilmersdon to Ammerdown and Norton St.
Philip, along a true exemplar of what geography

The delightful village of Norton St. Philip introduces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
a welcome change from these keen airs and
strenuous heights, for it basks in the mellow
atmosphere of a valley. The sweet-toned bells of
Norton still charm the ear of the traveller, and
are the identical “very fine ring of six bells”
that Pepys heard on June 12, 1668, and pronounced
“mighty tuneable,” ringing from the
grey church tower that stands so stately in
advance of the village. The George and the
Fleur-de-Lis, are both old inns, the first of
them historic as well, for it was the headquarters
of the Duke of Monmouth when the furious
skirmish was fought here, June 26, 1685, between
his rustics and the soldiers of King James. His
ploughmen won the day, but Monmouth himself
had a narrow escape the next morning, when he
was shot at while dressing at a window of the
George.</p>

<p>This house belonged of old to the Priory of
Hinton Charterhouse, whose ruins in the park of
Hinton “Abbey,” a modern residence, may be
seen adjoining the village of Hinton Charterhouse,
through which we proceed on the again hilly
way to Bath, which is six miles distant from it,
through Midford and Odd Down.</p>

<p>Many volumes might be written—and, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
have been, are being, and yet will be written—about
Bath, which is without doubt a very beautiful
and ancient and likeable city, with a long
history behind it, a vigorous present, and doubtless
a lengthy and prosperous future, so long as
its healing thermal springs shall last. The
antiquity of Bath is undoubtedly pre-Roman, but
to those mighty colonizers the first great development
of what they styled <i>Aquæ Solis</i>, the
“Waters of the Sun,” is due. A rival version of
that title is <i>Aquæ Sulis</i>, supposed to incorporate
the name of Sul, an unknown “early British
deity”; but the discovery of a sculptured face of
the sun-god, now in the museum, seems to support
the first name. Of course, the great traditional
founder of Bath, the true discoverer of the
medicinal springs, is, according to local patriotism,
Prince Bladud. A statue of him in the Grand
Pump Room, erected 1669, commits Bath to a
belief in the legend of that leprous Prince wandering,
863 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, an exile from his father’s Court, and
becoming healed in these waters. But Bladud
is an absolutely unhistorical personage. The
Romans, however, have left very substantial relics
of their presence. Does the general reader, it
may be asked, ever turn aside from his generalities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and particularly consider the great space of
time in which the Romans held Britain as a
prosperous colony? For nearly four centuries
they established themselves in this land, a settled
community, with the arts and civilization brought
from their native shores. Nay, they did more
than this, for they Romanized the Britons and
intermarried with them. England, the greatest
colonizing power of the modern world, has not
done so much. Less than two hundred years
covers the establishment of our Indian Empire,
and we have not mingled with the races of
Hindostan.</p>

  <div class="caption smaller">

<p>The Yarn Market, in the middle of the broad street, no longer witnesses the marketing of yarn or other goods.
It is, like Punster town itself, a picturesque survival.</p></div></div>

<p>The Roman baths at Bath are the best evidence
of the solidity of the civilization then founded;
and we have also to consider that Bath was then,
as it still remains, the premier health-resort in
these islands, and the discoveries of Roman villas
at Box and elsewhere along the Avon Valley show
that the district was what we should now style
“residential.” The destruction of all these graces
after the Roman forces left Britain, in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 410,
left <i>Aquæ Solis</i> a deserted ruin. It arose again as
the Saxon “Akemanceaster,” and was a considerable
town at the time of the Conquest. The
springs find little mention in the Middle Ages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
and only seem to have gradually won back to a
right appreciation from the time of Queen
Elizabeth onwards. It was the Consort of
Charles I., Queen Henrietta Maria, who in 1644
began the fashionable vogue of what was then
styled “the Bath”—a vogue continued and amplified
in the visits of Charles II. and his Court,
1663; of the Queen of James II., 1687; and with
the great favour shown the place by Queen Anne.
This fashionable and therapeutic reputation was
enormously enhanced in her time, the Corporation
building the Pump Room in 1704, and
appointing Beau Nash “Master of the Ceremonies.”
Still, however, Bath was a city of
merely rustic streets and medieval, or at the latest
Tudor, houses; and Bath as we see it to-day only
arose when Ralph Allen and John Wood began
to build its stately neo-classic streets and crescents
of fine houses in the middle of the eighteenth
century. For the fine architectural effect thus
produced Bath owes a very great deal to the fine
local oolite building-stone.</p>

<p>Prominent, however, above all else is the great
abbey church, which rises in its midst, and
challenges with its display of the last phase of
Gothic the Palladian severity of the secular buildings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
It is a complete and direct contradiction
of that eighteenth-century Bath; but how nobly
and effectively it stands forth from that sea of
houses which is the picture presented by Bath,
lying in its cuplike hollow beneath the great
surrounding hills!</p>

<p>“Go to Bath!” says the old contemptuous and
derisive saying. “Certainly!” one might well
reply. “By all means. Delighted.” And coming
to it along the stately curve which the Great
Western Railway makes between those lofty
heights, what an inspiring picture the city
presents! Bath is additionally famed for its
Pickwickian associations, and stands sponsor for
Bath chaps, Bath buns, and Bath Olivers. It
takes no responsibility in the matter of “Bath
bricks,” which intimate articles of domestic
economy are in fact made at Bridgwater, and
obtained their name no one knows when or how.</p>

<p>Of its other thousand and one architectural,
literary, artistic and social glories and associations,
I dare hint only guardedly in this small compass.
Of the abbey church, let it suffice to say that its
tower is not square in plan, and that the building
in general has a somewhat singular history. Large
though it be, it is but half the size of a Norman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
predecessor, begun but allowed to fall into decay.
It was begun anew in 1495 by Bishop Oliver
King, who dreamed a strange dream of angels
ascending ladders and a voice exclaiming, “Let
an olive establish the crown, and let a King restore
the church.” He had proceeded as far as the
west front when the Reformation ended his project,
and the great building remained derelict
for forty years. The work was resumed in 1572,
and brought to a conclusion about 1609. Thus
we have the unusual spectacle of a great abbey
church chiefly of post-Reformation date. The
odd reproduction in stone on the west front of
Bishop Oliver King’s dream, representing angels
climbing Jacob’s ladders, is more singular than
beautiful.</p>

<p>Box and Corsham, respectively six and nine
miles from Bath, to the east, along the old coach-road
to London, are worth an excursion, for here
you may see the quarries whence comes the fine-grained
Bath stone. Box Tunnel, on the Great
Western Railway, was considered a stupendous
work in the early days of railways. It is nearly
one and three-quarter miles long, and cost more
than half a million sterling. Corsham Regis,
to give that pretty village its full title, lies a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
way off the main road, and is, of course, a place
of stone-built houses and cottages, nearly all with
some architectural merit. The old weavers’ cottages
are still pointed out, the homes of a Flemish
community of clothworkers in Elizabethan times.
One may also obtain glimpses of Corsham Court,
a noble mansion amid gardens rich in enormous
yew hedges. It is the seat of Lord Methuen,
and was originally built in 1582 by one Smythe,
who grew rich in farming the Customs dues.
The Elizabethan south front remains. But what
will more immediately compel the tourist’s admiration
is the Hungerford Almshouse, a quaintly
beautiful composition, the gift of Lady Hungerford
in 1672. It is one of the finest among the
post-Reformation almshouses, with curious mingling
of debased Gothic and elaborate Renaissance
details over the projecting porch, among whose
florid sculptures will be noticed the crossed sickles
and wheatsheaf badge of the Hungerfords, who
have long since died out of the land.</p>

<p>Corsham is pretty, but one of the prettiest
villages in England will be found some four
miles north at Castle Combe, in a profound valley
through which flows the Box Brook. The castle
of Castle Combe has disappeared. It stood somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
on the lofty wooded heights that tower
above the secluded village. No modern house
varies the peaceful old cottage architecture of the
street, which follows the windings of the brook;
and the old church and roofed-in market-cross
complete the picture of a village unaltered since
the spacious times of Good Queen Bess.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
